## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Phase 0: Authentication Foundation (Days 1-2)

#### Task 0.1: Session Context Extension
Update core authentication to include household information:
```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
export interface SessionUser {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  household_id: number;  // NEW: household context
  household_name: string; // NEW: for UI display
}

// Update session validation to fetch household info
export async function validateSession(token: string): Promise<SessionUser | null> {
  // Join with households table to get household context
  const query = `
    SELECT u.*, h.name as household_name 
    FROM users u 
    JOIN households h ON u.household_id = h.id 
    WHERE u.id = ?
  `;
  // Implementation details...
}
```

#### Task 0.2: API Middleware Updates
Update `withAuth()` middleware to provide household context to API routes:
```typescript
// src/lib/middleware/withAuth.ts
export interface AuthenticatedRequest extends NextRequest {
  user: SessionUser;
  household_id: number; // NEW: direct access for API handlers
}

// All API routes now have household context available
export function withAuth<T>(
  handler: (request: AuthenticatedRequest, context: T) => Promise<Response>
) {
  return async (request: NextRequest, context: T) => {
    // Existing authentication logic...
    
    // NEW: Add household context to request
    const authenticatedRequest = request as AuthenticatedRequest;
    authenticatedRequest.user = user;
    authenticatedRequest.household_id = user.household_id;
    
    return handler(authenticatedRequest, context);
  };
}
```

#### Task 0.3: Permission System Foundation
Implement core permission validation system:
```typescript
// src/lib/permissions.ts
export async function canEditResource(
  user_household_id: number,
  resource_type: 'collections' | 'recipes' | 'ingredients' | 'plans' | 'shopping_lists',
  resource_id: number
): Promise<boolean> {
  const query = `SELECT household_id FROM ${resource_type} WHERE id = ?`;
  const [rows] = await pool.execute(query, [resource_id]);
  
  if (rows.length === 0) return false;
  return rows[0].household_id === user_household_id;
}

export async function validateHouseholdAccess(
  user_household_id: number,
  collection_id: number
): Promise<'owned' | 'subscribed' | 'public' | null> {
  // Implementation for collection access validation
}
```

### Phase 1: Core Query Functions (Days 3-5)

#### Task 1.1: Collection Query Optimization
Implement separate functions for different collection views:
```typescript
// src/lib/queries/collections.ts
export async function getMyCollections(household_id: number) {
  const query = `
    SELECT c.*, h.name as owner_name,
           CASE WHEN c.household_id = ? THEN 'owned' ELSE 'subscribed' END as access_type,
           COUNT(cr.recipe_id) as recipe_count,
           c.household_id = ? as can_edit,
           false as can_subscribe
    FROM collections c
    JOIN households h ON c.household_id = h.id
    LEFT JOIN collection_recipes cr ON c.id = cr.collection_id
    LEFT JOIN collection_subscriptions cs ON c.id = cs.collection_id AND cs.household_id = ?
    WHERE c.household_id = ? OR cs.household_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY c.id
    ORDER BY access_type, c.title
  `;
}

export async function getPublicCollections(household_id: number) {
  const query = `
    SELECT c.*, h.name as owner_name,
           CASE WHEN cs.household_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'subscribed' ELSE 'public' END as access_type,
           COUNT(cr.recipe_id) as recipe_count,
           false as can_edit,
           cs.household_id IS NULL as can_subscribe
    FROM collections c
    JOIN households h ON c.household_id = h.id
    LEFT JOIN collection_recipes cr ON c.id = cr.collection_id
    LEFT JOIN collection_subscriptions cs ON c.id = cs.collection_id AND cs.household_id = ?
    WHERE c.public = 1
    GROUP BY c.id
    ORDER BY c.title
  `;
}
```

#### Task 1.2: Recipe Query with Household Precedence
Implement `searchRecipesWithPrecedence()` and `getRecipesInCollection()`:
```typescript
// Show household's customized version preferentially
export async function getRecipesInCollection(collection_id: number, household_id: number) {
  // Enhanced junction table query with collection context and household precedence
  const query = `
    SELECT r.*, cr.added_at, cr.display_order,
           CASE WHEN r.household_id = ? THEN 'customized'
                WHEN r.household_id = c.household_id THEN 'original'
                ELSE 'referenced' END as status,
           c.household_id as collection_household_id,
           c.url_slug as current_collection_slug,
           ? as current_collection_id,
           (r.household_id = ?) as user_owns_recipe,
           (c.household_id = ?) as user_owns_collection
    FROM collection_recipes cr
    JOIN recipes r ON cr.recipe_id = r.id
    JOIN collections c ON cr.collection_id = c.id
    WHERE cr.collection_id = ?
    AND (
        r.household_id = ? 
        OR 
        (r.household_id != ?
         AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM recipes r2 
            WHERE r2.household_id = ? 
            AND r2.parent_id = r.id
        ))
    )
    ORDER BY cr.display_order, cr.added_at
  `;
  const [rows] = await pool.execute(query, [
    household_id, collection_id, household_id, household_id, collection_id, 
    household_id, household_id, household_id
  ]);
  
  // Transform rows to include access_context
  return rows.map(row => ({
    ...row,
    current_collection_id: row.current_collection_id,
    current_collection_slug: row.current_collection_slug,
    access_context: {
      collection_household_id: row.collection_household_id,
      recipe_household_id: row.household_id,

      user_owns_recipe: !!row.user_owns_recipe
    }
  }));
}
```

    };
  } catch (error) {
    await connection.rollback();
    throw error;
  } finally {

  }
}

// Original optimized collection copying (still used for subscription scenarios)
export async function copyCollectionOptimized(source_id: number, target_household_id: number) {
  const connection = await pool.getConnection();
  try {
    await connection.beginTransaction();
    
    // Copy collection record only
    const copyQuery = `

      SELECT CONCAT(title, ' (Copy)'), subtitle, filename, filename_dark, ?, id, 0
      FROM collections WHERE id = ?
    `;
    
    // Copy junction records (12 bytes each vs 500+ bytes for recipe records)
    const junctionQuery = `

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Functional Test Coverage
- [ ] All query functions tested with multiple household scenarios
- [ ] All API endpoints tested with permission validation
- [ ] Copy-on-write logic tested with transaction rollback scenarios
- [ ] Subscription management tested with all state transitions
- [ ] Permission system tested with boundary conditions

#### Security Test Coverage  
- [ ] Household isolation verified - no cross-household data leakage
- [ ] Permission enforcement tested - no unauthorized edit/delete operations
- [ ] Subscription validation tested - no access to unsubscribed content
- [ ] Copy-on-write security tested - no unauthorized copying

#### Performance Test Coverage
- [ ] Copy-on-write operations tested under 500ms for typical collections
- [ ] Search queries with household precedence tested under 100ms

#### Edge Case Test Coverage
- [ ] Empty household scenarios (no owned/subscribed collections)
- [ ] Large dataset scenarios (1000+ collections, 10000+ recipes)
- [ ] Concurrent operation scenarios (multiple users copying simultaneously)
- [ ] Subscription state change scenarios (subscribe during copy operation)
- [ ] Parent-child relationship scenarios (editing with complex lineage)

### Test Data Setup

#### Required Test Fixtures
```typescript
// Test database with multiple households
const testHouseholds = ['Spencer', 'Johnson', 'Williams'];

// Test collections with various ownership and subscription states  
const testCollections = [
  { id: 1, household: 'Spencer', public: true },  // Spencer's essentials
  { id: 2, household: 'Spencer', public: true },  // Spencer's Italian
  { id: 3, household: 'Spencer', public: false }, // Spencer's private
  { id: 4, household: 'Johnson', public: false }, // Johnson's private
];

// Test subscription states
const testSubscriptions = [
  { household: 'Johnson', collection: 1 }, // Subscribed to Spencer's essentials
  { household: 'Williams', collection: 1 }, // Subscribed to Spencer's essentials
];

// Test recipes with parent-child relationships
const testRecipes = [
  { id: 101, household: 'Spencer', parent: null },     // Original
  { id: 201, household: 'Johnson', parent: 101 },     // Johnson's copy
  { id: 301, household: 'Williams', parent: 201 },    // Williams' copy of Johnson's copy
];
```

### Test Execution Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Run during development for immediate feedback
2. **Integration Tests**: Run on every commit to validate complete flows  
3. **Performance Tests**: Run weekly to catch performance regressions
4. **Security Tests**: Run on every deployment to validate household isolation
5. **Load Tests**: Run monthly with production-scale data
