- Add `parent_id INT NULL` for copy tracking
- Create all foreign key constraints and indexes

#### Task 2.3: Recipe Copy-on-Write Setup
- Remove `collection_id` from `recipes` table (replaced by junction)
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `recipes` table
- Add `parent_id INT NULL` for lineage tracking
- Create foreign key constraints and indexes

#### Task 2.4: Ingredient & Recipe Ingredient Modifications

- Create composite indexes on `(household_id, week, year)`

### Phase 3: Migration Execution (Days 5-6)

#### Task 3.1: Spencer Household Creation & User Assignment
```sql
-- Create Spencer household and assign all existing users
INSERT INTO households (name) VALUES ('Spencer');
SET @spencer_household_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Assign all existing users to Spencer household
UPDATE users SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
```

#### Task 3.2: Resource Ownership Assignment
```sql
-- Spencer owns all existing collections, recipes, and ingredients
UPDATE collections SET household_id = @spencer_household_id, public = 0;
-- Make collection_id=1 public by default (Spencer's essentials)
UPDATE collections SET public = 1 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE recipes SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE ingredients SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE plans SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE shopping_lists SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
```

#### Task 3.3: Junction Table Population
```sql
-- Migrate existing recipe-collection relationships
INSERT INTO collection_recipes (collection_id, recipe_id, added_at)
SELECT collection_id, id, NOW() 
FROM recipes 
WHERE collection_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Auto-subscribe all households to collection_id=1
INSERT INTO collection_subscriptions (household_id, collection_id)
SELECT h.id, 1 FROM households h
WHERE 1 IN (SELECT id FROM collections WHERE id = 1);
```

### Phase 4: Application Copy-on-Write Functions (Day 7)

#### Task 4.1: Enhanced Collection Context-Aware Copy-on-Write Functions
Implement both the original copy-on-write functions AND the enhanced collection context-aware functions:

**File Structure:**
- `src/lib/copy-on-write.ts` - Main copy-on-write functions
- `src/lib/queries/copy-operations.ts` - Database query utilities for copy operations
- `src/lib/copy-on-write.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `src/lib/queries/copy-operations.test.ts` - Database query tests

**Original Functions** (from parent spec "Edit Triggers Copy" section):
- `copyRecipeForEdit()` - Single recipe copying with junction table updates and transaction management
- `copyIngredientForEdit()` - Single ingredient copying with recipe updates and proper error handling

**Enhanced Collection Context-Aware Functions** (for URL routing scenarios):
- `cascadeCopyWithContext()` - Collection + recipe cascade copying with collection context validation
- `cascadeCopyIngredientWithContext()` - Full collection â†’ recipe â†’ ingredient cascade copying

These enhanced functions handle the critical collection context scenarios identified:
- Spencer edits Williams collection â†’ Johnson recipe (copies both collection and recipe)
- Spencer edits subscribed collection â†’ owned recipe (copies collection only)  
- Spencer edits owned collection â†’ external recipe (copies recipe only)

The enhanced functions validate entire ownership chains and ensure complete resource isolation for multi-household editing scenarios accessed via `/recipes/[collection_slug]/[recipe_slug]` URLs.

**Function Signatures:**
```typescript
// Main copy-on-write functions
export async function copyRecipeForEdit(
  recipeId: number, 
  householdId: number
): Promise<{ newRecipeId: number; copied: boolean }>;

export async function copyIngredientForEdit(
  ingredientId: number, 
  householdId: number
): Promise<{ newIngredientId: number; copied: boolean }>;

export async function cascadeCopyWithContext(
  householdId: number,
  collectionId: number, 
  recipeId: number
): Promise<{
  newCollectionId: number;
  newRecipeId: number;
  actionsTaken: string[];
}>;

export async function cascadeCopyIngredientWithContext(
  householdId: number,
  collectionId: number,
  recipeId: number, 
  ingredientId: number
): Promise<{
  newCollectionId: number;
  newRecipeId: number;
  newIngredientId: number;
  actionsTaken: string[];
}>;
```

#### Task 4.2: Application-Level Cleanup Logic
Implement application-level cleanup functions to replace database triggers:

**Functions to Implement:**
- `cleanupOrphanedIngredients()` - Clean up orphaned household-owned ingredients after recipe deletion
- `cleanupOrphanedRecipeIngredients()` - Clean up recipe_ingredients entries after recipe deletion
- Integration with existing delete API endpoints to call cleanup functions

**Function Signatures:**
```typescript
export async function cleanupOrphanedIngredients(
  householdId: number, 
  deletedRecipeId: number
): Promise<{ deletedIngredientIds: number[] }>;

export async function cleanupOrphanedRecipeIngredients(
  recipeId: number
): Promise<{ deletedCount: number }>;
```

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Days 8-10)

#### Task 5.1: Data Integrity Validation
- Verify all foreign key constraints are properly created
- Confirm all existing data migrated without loss
- Test that all NOT NULL constraints are satisfied

#### Task 5.2: Performance Testing
- Benchmark junction table queries vs old collection_id queries
- Test copy function performance with large datasets
- Validate index effectiveness on household-scoped queries

#### Task 5.3: System Verification
After completing all database changes, run comprehensive verification to ensure the system still works correctly:

```bash
# RUN THESE COMMANDS to verify the system after database migration:

# 1. TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. ESLint check for any code that may be affected by schema changes
npm run lint

# 3. Run all tests to ensure database changes don't break existing functionality
npm run test

# 4. Build check to ensure the application can still build successfully
npm run build
```

**Verification Requirements:**
- All commands must pass without errors
- If any tests fail due to schema changes, document them for Agent 2 to address
- Ensure database migrations didn't break existing authentication or query functionality
- Confirm that copy-on-write functions work as expected

- **Idempotent**: Ensure SQL is idempotent so it's safe to run multiple times

### Medium Risk: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, optimize indexes proactively
- **Idempotent**: Ensure SQL is idempotent so it's safe to run multiple times

### Medium Risk: Complex Copy Functions
- **Mitigation**: Extensive unit testing, step-by-step validation, comprehensive test coverage
- **Transaction Safety**: Ensure all copy functions use proper transaction management

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each copy function in isolation with mocked database calls
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete migration flow on test data
3. **Copy Function Tests**: Test all copy-on-write scenarios with real database transactions
4. **Transaction Tests**: Verify rollback behavior on copy function failures
