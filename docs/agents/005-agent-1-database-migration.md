# Agent 1: Database & Migration Implementation

**Parent Spec:** [005-household-feature-spec.md](../specs/005-household-feature-spec.md)  
**Agent Role:** Database Schema & Migration Specialist  
**Assigned Sections:** Database Schema Changes (Â§1), Data Migration Strategy (Â§5)

## Required reading

Agent 1 must read these docs:
- [schema.sql](../db/schema.sql)
- [005-household-feature-spec.md](../specs/005-household-feature-spec.md)
- [001-current-system-architecture-spec.md](../specs/001-current-system-architecture-spec.md)

## Git Workflow Requirements

### Branch Management
**BEFORE starting any work**, Agent 1 must create and checkout a dedicated branch:

```bash
# Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/household-feature-integration-agent-1
git push -u origin feature/household-feature-integration-agent-1
```

### Commit Strategy
**AFTER each completed task**, Agent 1 must commit and push changes:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message referencing task
git commit -m "feat: [Task X.Y] Brief description of changes

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Schema Creation (Days 1-2)

#### Task 1.1: Core Household Infrastructure
```sql
-- Create households table with proper indexing
CREATE TABLE households (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_name (name)
);
```

#### Task 1.2: Junction Table Implementation
```sql
-- Create collection_recipes junction table (key optimization)
CREATE TABLE collection_recipes (
    collection_id INT NOT NULL,
    recipe_id INT NOT NULL,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    display_order INT DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (collection_id, recipe_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (collection_id) REFERENCES collections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_recipe_collection (recipe_id, collection_id),
    INDEX idx_display_order (collection_id, display_order)
);
```

#### Task 1.3: Subscription System
```sql
-- Create collection_subscriptions table
CREATE TABLE collection_subscriptions (
    household_id INT NOT NULL,
    collection_id INT NOT NULL,
    subscribed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (household_id, collection_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (household_id) REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (collection_id) REFERENCES collections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_household (household_id),
    INDEX idx_collection (collection_id)
);
```

### Phase 2: Table Modifications (Days 3-4)

#### Task 2.1: User-Household Relationship
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `users` table
- Create foreign key constraint to `households`
- Add index on `household_id`

#### Task 2.2: Collection Ownership
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `collections` table
- Add `public TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0` for sharing control
- Add `parent_id INT NULL` for copy tracking
- Create all foreign key constraints and indexes

#### Task 2.3: Recipe Copy-on-Write Setup
- Remove `collection_id` from `recipes` table (replaced by junction)
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `recipes` table
- Add `parent_id INT NULL` for lineage tracking
- Create foreign key constraints and indexes

#### Task 2.4: Ingredient & Recipe Ingredient Modifications
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `ingredients` table
- Add `parent_id INT NULL` to both `ingredients` and `recipe_ingredients`
- Create all foreign key constraints and indexes

#### Task 2.5: Private Data Modifications
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `plans` table
- Add `household_id INT NOT NULL` to `shopping_lists` table
- Create composite indexes on `(household_id, week, year)`

### Phase 3: Migration Execution (Days 5-6)

#### Task 3.1: Spencer Household Creation & User Assignment
```sql
-- Create Spencer household and assign all existing users
INSERT INTO households (name) VALUES ('Spencer');
SET @spencer_household_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Assign all existing users to Spencer household
UPDATE users SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
```

#### Task 3.2: Resource Ownership Assignment
```sql
-- Spencer owns all existing collections, recipes, and ingredients
UPDATE collections SET household_id = @spencer_household_id, public = 0;
-- Make collection_id=1 public by default (Spencer's essentials)
UPDATE collections SET public = 1 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE recipes SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE ingredients SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE plans SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
UPDATE shopping_lists SET household_id = @spencer_household_id;
```

#### Task 3.3: Junction Table Population
```sql
-- Migrate existing recipe-collection relationships
INSERT INTO collection_recipes (collection_id, recipe_id, added_at)
SELECT collection_id, id, NOW() 
FROM recipes 
WHERE collection_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Auto-subscribe all households to collection_id=1
INSERT INTO collection_subscriptions (household_id, collection_id)
SELECT h.id, 1 FROM households h
WHERE 1 IN (SELECT id FROM collections WHERE id = 1);
```

### Phase 4: Stored Procedures & Triggers (Day 7)

#### Task 4.1: Enhanced Collection Context-Aware Copy-on-Write Procedures
Implement both the original copy-on-write procedures AND the enhanced collection context-aware procedures:

**Original Procedures** (from parent spec "Edit Triggers Copy" section):
- `CopyRecipeForEdit()` - Single recipe copying with junction table updates
- `CopyIngredientForEdit()` - Single ingredient copying with recipe updates

**Enhanced Collection Context-Aware Procedures** (for URL routing scenarios):
- `CascadeCopyWithContext()` - Collection + recipe cascade copying with collection context validation
- `CascadeCopyIngredientWithContext()` - Full collection â†’ recipe â†’ ingredient cascade copying

These enhanced procedures handle the critical collection context scenarios identified:
- Spencer edits Williams collection â†’ Johnson recipe (copies both collection and recipe)
- Spencer edits subscribed collection â†’ owned recipe (copies collection only)  
- Spencer edits owned collection â†’ external recipe (copies recipe only)

The enhanced procedures validate entire ownership chains and ensure complete resource isolation for multi-household editing scenarios accessed via `/recipes/[collection_slug]/[recipe_slug]` URLs.

#### Task 4.2: Cleanup Triggers
Implement the `cleanup_after_recipe_delete` trigger to automatically clean up orphaned household-owned ingredients.

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Days 8-10)

#### Task 5.1: Data Integrity Validation
- Verify all foreign key constraints are properly created
- Confirm all existing data migrated without loss
- Test that all NOT NULL constraints are satisfied

#### Task 5.2: Performance Testing
- Benchmark junction table queries vs old collection_id queries
- Test stored procedure performance with large datasets
- Validate index effectiveness on household-scoped queries

#### Task 5.3: Rollback Procedures
- Document complete rollback procedure for migration
- Test rollback on development copy
- Prepare emergency rollback scripts

#### Task 5.4: System Verification
After completing all database changes, run comprehensive verification to ensure the system still works correctly:

```bash
# RUN THESE COMMANDS to verify the system after database migration:

# 1. TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit

# 2. ESLint check for any code that may be affected by schema changes
npm run lint

# 3. Run all tests to ensure database changes don't break existing functionality
npm run test

# 4. Build check to ensure the application can still build successfully
npm run build
```

**Verification Requirements:**
- All commands must pass without errors
- If any tests fail due to schema changes, document them for Agent 2 to address
- Ensure database migrations didn't break existing authentication or query functionality
- Confirm that stored procedures and triggers work as expected

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Data Loss During Migration
- **Mitigation**: Full database backup before migration, comprehensive testing on staging
- **Rollback**: Complete rollback procedure documented and tested

### Medium Risk: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, optimize indexes proactively
- **Rollback**: Performance rollback to previous schema if needed

### Medium Risk: Complex Stored Procedures
- **Mitigation**: Extensive unit testing, step-by-step validation
- **Rollback**: Disable procedures, manual copy process as fallback

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each stored procedure in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete migration flow on test data
4. **Rollback Tests**: Verify complete rollback capability
5. **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity at each migration step

## Handoff to Other Agents
